# YouNow Battleship Chat Game
 A fun game to add to OBS as a browser source. Great for break times or as part of a game night with viewers. 
 * How to Play: With the browser source active in the scene, all the chat will need to do is enter a grid location in chat to play ex: a0, G4, c2, etc. As the game progresses, the hits will be logged showing the user profile pic. The game will restart when all ships are sunk. There are 3 ship, 3 blocks long. They can be horizontal or verticle.
